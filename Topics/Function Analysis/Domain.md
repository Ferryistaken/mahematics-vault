The domain of a function is the set of inputs accepted by the function. Usually, all the values that $x$ can take while still being mathematically correct.

The "opposite" of the domain is the [[codomain]], or the set of values that the _function_ can take, usually, all values that $y$ can take while still being mathematically correct.
