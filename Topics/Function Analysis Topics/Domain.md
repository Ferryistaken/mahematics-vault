# Definition
The **domain** of a function is the set of **inputs** accepted by the function. Usually, all the values that $x$ can take while still being mathematically correct.

The "opposite" of the domain is the [[Codomain]].

# How to Find the Domain
To find the domain of a function, we must exclude all values of $x$ that could cause problems. As an example:
- Values that make the denominator $= 0$.
- Values that make what's under a square root with an even index $< 0$.
- Values that break the domain of other function, like $log(-3)$.
- Etc.

## What to do when we find the domain
Once we find the domain, we should write is as an interval, for example:

$$
D_f = (-\infty; -3] \cup [-3; 4) \cup (4; +\infty)
$$

By writing the domain in this way, we can already tell how many [[Limits]] we will need to calculate in order to find out [[Boundedness]], [[Asymptotes]], and [[Singularities]]
