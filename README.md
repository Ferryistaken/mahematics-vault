Knowledge garden containing most of the high school level math that I know. Made public for everyone to use.

This repo should be very useful if you're trying to refresh on some concepts, as everything is short and sweet and very organized.

I wrote this whole thing in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a very useful tool for writing notes, with some nice features such as front and backlinks, meaning that every note can be connected to every other note. This makes it so that every concept can be referenced in every other note, which makes obsidian very useful when organizing large knowledge bases with a lot of short, interconnected topics, such as mathematics.

Even though I used Obsidian, all files are writtein in utf-8 encoded .md files, which are just text files, so you can view this in any text editor(although without any of the nice features).
